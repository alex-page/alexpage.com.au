### [md] [游닉 Names and positive culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xAKir02gto)
Communication is hard, what we name things affects how well we communicate. Simple interactions like getting a haircut or ordering an ice cream can increase anxiety due to communication. Poor communication can change outcomes, how things are perceived and how they are used. When building a design system we have to name a lot of things. Some times the names we give should be functional and understandable and other times there are opportunities to be creative and create a positive culture.

### [md] [游닉 Hard work to make it simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol9t-ERYqFM)
Shared wisdom with Trevor Brennan at Australia's first ever design system meetup. We talked about how to provide a common language for typography, spacing alignment, and an accessible colour contrast system, at a scale suitable for a nation.

### [md] [游닉 React js in government](/talks/react-government)
Talked at the CanberraJS meetup about how to utilise Reacts frontend framework while still being accessible to users without javascript. The focus of this discussion was to rethink the application of javascript frameworks by government and modern ways we can solve this problem.

### [md] [游닉 Living styleguides](/talks/living-styleguides)
Spoke at DrupalGov, Canberra on how living styleguides can provide consistent, scalable and accessible user experiences. Shared how I had been creating simple living styleguides in Drupal using the zen theme.
