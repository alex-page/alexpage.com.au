> Launching the Australian Government Design System with Trevor Brennan at Australia's first ever Design System Meetup.

Trevor and I were invited to talk at the first ever [Design System Meetup v1.0.0](https://designsystemmeetup.com/v1.0.0/). We talked about how we broke down barriers between developers and designers by providing a common language for typography and spacing alignment.

I talk about how we balanced flexibility with accessibility. Discussing how we made an accessible colour palette that would meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) level AA 2.1 while allowing the user to customise the palette.

All of this at a scale suitable for a nation.
