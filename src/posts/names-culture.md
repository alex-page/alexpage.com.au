I was invited to talk at [Design System Meetup v4.0.0](https://designsystemmeetup.com/v4.0.0/) about names and culture.

Simple interactions like getting a haircut or ordering an ice cream can increase anxiety due to communication. Poor communication can change outcomes, how things are perceived and how they are used.

When building a design system we have to name a lot of things. Sometimes the names we give should be functional and understandable and other times there are opportunities to be creative and create a culture.
