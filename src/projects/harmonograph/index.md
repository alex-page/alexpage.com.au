A Harmonograph is a swinging platform where a pen attached to a pendulum, draws intricate shapes and patterns on paper.

As a child I used to visit the National Science and Technology Centre and see the harmonograph they had on display. A Harmonograph is a swinging platform where a pen attached to a pendulum, draws intricate shapes and patterns on paper.

Inspired I decided to make an npm package, [harmonograph](/projects/harmonograph). The package draws a randomised harmonograph using JavaScript and SVG bezier curves. The project was a perfect blend of code and design.
