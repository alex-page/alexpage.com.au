summary: Get started with the Australian Government Design System by selecting components and downloading a zip file.
---
I led the development on [Furnace](https://designsystem.gov.au/download), a tool that removes the barrier to entry for users unfamiliar to _npm_ by allowing them to easily download a zip file of the design system.

Furnace is a NodeJS API that bundles component dependencies based on user input, outputting the result to a zip file. The development included building the user interface, server, continuous integration, continuous deployment, unit and integration tests.
