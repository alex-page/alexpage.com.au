As the Lead User Experience Engineer I worked in a team to launch the [Australian Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au) to align 1000+ websites over 200+ organisations.

It was received as a [world class example](https://twitter.com/i/moments/970119499427938304). It included accessibility guidance, rationales of design decisions and prominent contributors. 

We created and supported our federated community on [Discourse](http://community.digital.gov.au), [GitHub](https://github.com/govau/design-system-components) and Slack that drove the future direction of the design system.

We continuously maintained, created and enhanced the 25+ components. The components met Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) level AA 2.1 and best practice HTML, React, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and SASS.
