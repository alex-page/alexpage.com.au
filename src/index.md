# Hey, Iâ€™m Alex

> I write code that connects pixels to people. I lead multidisciplinary teams to build communities and create systems with modern technology and thoughtful design.

I am a front-end development manager at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) working on the [Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com), helping solve common problems at scale. I was the Lead User Experience Engineer on the [Australian Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au). I worked in a team to align 1000+ websites over 200+ organisations.
