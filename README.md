> I specialise in design systems, JavaScript, open-source and accessibility. I love solving problems at scale with systemisation, automation, modern technology and thoughtful design.

I am a User Experience Development Manager at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) working on the [Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com/), helping solve common problems at scale. I was the Lead User Experience Engineer on the [Australian Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au/). I worked in a team to align 1000+ websites over 200+ organisations.
